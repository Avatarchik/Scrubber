Scrubber
========

**Scrubber** is an experimental presentation tool that mainly focuses on
playing back pre-recorded videos. It supports flawless playhead control (like
scrubbing on video editing software) with a scroll wheel, so that you can
smoothly synchronize the pace of the video and your speech.
